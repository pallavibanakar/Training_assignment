Factory Pattern:
Problem:Every time you want to login to any social website,you will need to login seperatly in each  social website.

So with use of Factory pattern we create a  Social login Factory which creates objects of all social website(like facebook,twitter) if you login in only once.



Observer Pattern:
Problem:Every time the social network need to check if any registration has happened or not and send a notification to user to his/her email_id.

So with use of observer pattern we will be able to create a observer that is the email service which will be notified about any registration and email service will handel the nofication to user.


Sigleton Pattern:
There is a specific implementation of the login interface, which is consistence so the classes have to be singleton

So Sigleton class of Social website are created.


Facade Pattern:
Problem:In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client.

so Facade pattern to expose a simple interface for your social login factory user.
